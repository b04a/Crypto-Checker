# Crypto-Checker
Project - Crypto Checker
Programming language - Swift
The framework - UIKit, WebKit

What's new:
- In this project I put my efforts and knowledge that I gained by studying the UIKit framework. It was studied a lot of elements, but in this project not all the elements are affected.

The program accepts 2 parameters:
- Cryptocurrency name (abbreviation)
- Name of currency (abbreviation)
The program takes 2 parameters (crypto and currency) and after clicking the button it goes to the 2nd screen, where it opens a web window with a link tradingview.com, which already has entered the pre-selected data.

It took me about 10 hours to complete the project! So far this is my coolest project I've done by myself (also there is an assumption that I spent most of the time on the UI design, because I had no Photoshop and had to use online editors)

Enclosing only the code, no assets
